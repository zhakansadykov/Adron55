   The HADRON-55 facility, located in Almaty, is an ionization calorimeter designed to study the interactions of high-energy particles such as hadrons in the framework of studies of cosmic rays and broad atmospheric showers (SHAL). It is located at an altitude of 3340 meters above sea level and is part of the Tien Shan High-altitude Scientific Station.

Basic installation parameters:
Type of calorimeter: Ionization calorimeter with iron and lead absorbers.

Appointment:

Measurement of particle energy through total ionization.

Investigation of the central part of the SHAWL trunks.

Determination of the composition and energy spectrum of cosmic rays.

Measurement accuracy: The error is about 10%, which ensures high data reliability.

Components:

Hadron and muon components for the analysis of particle interactions.

Neutron counters for recording neutron fluxes resulting from the development of SHAL.

Software: Data processing is carried out using programs developed in the C++ language.

The principle of operation:
The calorimeter captures the energy of particles passing through the absorber layers by measuring the ionization created by these particles. This makes it possible to study the interactions of ultrahigh-energy particles that cannot be reproduced in the laboratory.
